# PDH Test - Flutter

This is a simple Flutter test project used in the interview process to gauge problem solving and technical knowledge.

## Requirements

A `SleepDashboardCard` should be rendered displaying the latest sleep data. The data is available in `SleepController.data` as a List and will always be an instance of `SleepTrackingData`.

A `LoadingDashboardCard` should be displayed if we are fetching new data (`SleepController.isLoading`). The screen has 'pull to refresh' functionality to load new data.

The `SleepDashboardCard` widget should reflect [the design](https://xd.adobe.com/view/0af8023b-b417-4a62-9ca2-994bd7130439-5fab/specs/) and use preconfigured constants and enums where appropriate.
